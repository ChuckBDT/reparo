# Reparo 🪄

**A simple and efficient repair tracking tool for independent IT technicians.**

Reparo helps you keep track of your clients' machines and repair history in one place. No more scattered notes or forgotten follow-ups.

## What it does

- **Client & Machine Management**: Store client information and their devices (brand, model, serial number, purchase date)
- **Repair History**: Track all interventions performed on each machine with detailed notes
- **Status Tracking**: Mark repairs as "in progress", "resolved", or "follow-up required" with reminder dates
- **Follow-up Dashboard**: Never miss a callback with a centralized view of pending follow-ups

## Why Reparo?

Built by a former IT repair shop owner who needed exactly this tool. Most repair management software is either too complex, too expensive, or not adapted to independent technicians and small repair businesses.

Reparo is free, open-source, and focused on doing one thing well: tracking machines and repairs.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express/Fastify + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React
- **Architecture**: REST API with JWT authentication

## Project Status

🚧 **Currently in development** - MVP in progress

This is a learning project to build a full-stack application from scratch. The goal is to create a functional tool that solves a real problem while improving full-stack development skills.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Phase 1: Backend API - Clients & Machines
- [ ] Phase 2: Backend API - Interventions & Status
- [ ] Phase 3: Frontend - Client & Machine Management
- [ ] Phase 4: Frontend - Repair Tracking & Dashboard
- [ ] Phase 5: User Testing & Feedback

## Contributing

This project is currently a solo learning endeavor, but feedback and suggestions are welcome once the MVP is ready for testing.
